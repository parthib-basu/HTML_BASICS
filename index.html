<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><STRONG><a href="www.google.com" TARGET="_BLANK">India</a></STRONG> is a country which is located near the equator, it receives approximately 3000 hours of sunshine every year which is equivalent to 5000 trillion kWh of energy. India has got the ability to generate over 1,900 billion units of solar power annually, which is equal to the entire annual power demand till 2030. The future of India depends on achieving the ambitious solar power generation target of 100 GW by 2022. The cumulative solar capacity is going up to 15.6 GW, as recorded on June 30, 2019, the market sentiment is upbeat because of the record number of installations. Solar panels usually have a lifespan of around 25 years and are definitely worth the investment in every respect. The use of solar energy to power electrical appliances eliminates any dependency whatsoever on the constant supply of electricity to any place. Solar power is also good riddance of hefty monthly electricity bills for the common man. All these factors prove that this business is feasible and profitable.</P>
<H4>SUBSIY DETAILS:</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> 30% upfront subsidy through <STRONG>IPGCL</STRONG> is available for residential, institutional and social sector consumers in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The customer shall pay the differential amount i.e. Customer Share = Project Cost - Subsidy Amount. Under the scheme, the government will provide a generation-based incentive of Rs 2 per unit against the initial solar power generation cost of Rs 3 per unit. In effect, the consumer will pay just Rs 1 per unit for five years.</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<STRONG>Step 6:</STRONG> Make a seal. Time to complete would be 1 day. Cost incurred would be INR 350 (cost depends on the number of seals required and the time period for delivery). Although making a company seal is not a legal requirement for the company to be incorporated, companies require a seal to issue share certificates and other documents. The cost depends on the number of words to be engraved, the number of seals required, and the time period for delivery. The cost can range from INR 300 to INR 500.
<BR></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<STRONG>Step 7:</STRONG> Obtain a Permanent Account Number (PAN) from an authorized franchise or agent appointed by the National Securities Depository Ltd. (NSDL) or the Unit Trust of India (UTI) Investors Services Ltd., as outsourced by the Income Tax Department. Time to complete would be 7 days. Cost incurred would be INR 67 (INR 60 application fee + 12.36% service tax + INR 5 for application form, if not downloaded). Under the Income Tax Act, 1961, each person must quote his or her Permanent Account Number (PAN) for tax payment purposes and the Tax Account Number (TAN) for depositing tax deducted at source. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has instructed banks not to accept any form for tax payment (challan) without the PAN or TAN, as applicable. The PAN is a 10-digit alphanumeric number issued on a laminated card by an assessing officer of the Income Tax Department.
<BR>
In order to improve PAN-related services, the Income Tax department (effective July 2003) outsourced their operations pertaining to allotment of PAN and issuance of PAN cards to UTI Investor Services Ltd, which was authorized to set up and manage IT PAN Service Centers in all cities where there is an Income Tax office. The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) has also launched PAN operations effective June 2004, setting up TIN Facilitation Centers.
<BR>
The PAN application is made through the above mentioned service centers using Form 49A, with a certified copy of the certificate of registration, issued by the Registrar of Companies, along with proof of company address and personal identity. A fee of INR 60 (plus applicable taxes) applies for processing the PAN application. IT PAN Service Centers or TIN Facilitation Centers will supply PAN application forms (Form 49A), assist the applicant in filling out the form, collect filled-out forms, and issue an acknowledgement slip. After obtaining PAN from the Income Tax department, UTIISL or NSDL as the case may be, will print the PAN card and deliver it to the applicant.
<BR>
The application for PAN can also be made online but the documents still need to be physically dropped off for verification with the authorized agent.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<STRONG>Step 8:</STRONG> Obtain a Tax Account Number (TAN) for income taxes deducted at source from the Assessing Office in the Mumbai Income Tax Department. Time to complete would be 7 days. Cost incurred would be INR 57 (INR 50 application fee + 12.36% service tax). The Tax Account Number (TAN) is a 10-digit alphanumeric number required of anyone responsible for deducting or collecting tax. The provisions of Section 203A of the Income Tax Act require that all persons who deduct or collect tax at the source must apply for a TAN. The section also makes it mandatory for the TAN to be quoted in all tax-deducted-at-source (TDS) and tax-collected-at-source (TCS) returns, all TDS/TCS payment challans, and all TDS/TCS certificates issued.
<BR>
Failure to apply for a TAN or to comply with any of the other provisions of the section is subject to a penalty of INR 10,000/- . The application for allotment of a TAN must be filed using Form 49B and submitted at any TIN Facilitation Center authorized to receive e-TDS returns.
<BR>
Locations of TIN Facilitation Centres can be found at www.incometaxindia.gov.in and the processing fee for both applications (a new TAN or a change request) is INR 50 (plus applicable taxes). After verification of application, the same is sent to the Income Tax Department and upon satisfaction the department issues the TAN to the applicant. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<STRONG>Step 9:</STRONG> Register with the Office of Inspector, Shops, and Establishment Act. Time to complete would be 2 days. Cost incurred would be INR 6,500 (INR 2000 + 3 times registration fee for trade refuse charges). A statement containing the employer-“s and manager-“s names and the establishment’s name, postal address, and category must be sent to the local shop inspector with the applicable fees.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<STRONG>Step 10:</STRONG> Register for Value-Added Tax (VAT) at the Commercial Tax Office. Time to complete would be 12 days. Cost incurred would be INR 5,100 (registration fee INR 5000 + stamp duty INR 100). Beginning April 1, 2005, the sales tax was replaced by the VAT, which requires registration by filing Form 101.
The authorized representative signing the application must be available at the Sales-Tax Office on the day of application verification. The applicant goes to the Sales-Tax Office and up to the registration counter. The clerk at the counter verifies that the applicant has all the required documents and gives the applicant a token (waiting number). After a short wait, the applicant-“s number is called and the applicant approaches the desk of a sales-tax officer.
There, all the information on Form 101 is manually entered into the system by the officer. Within 10 minutes, the system generates a Tax Identification Number (TIN). Thereafter, the company is considered fully registered to pay taxes. However, the applicant must wait between 10 and 15 days to receive the VAT registration certificate by mail.
In addition to Form 101, other accompanying documentation includes:
<UL>
<LI>Certified true copy of the memorandum and articles of association of the company;-</LI>
<LI>Proof of permanent residential address. At least 2 of the following documents must be submitted: copy of passport, copy of driver’s license, copy of election photo identity card, copy of property card or latest receipt of property tax from the Municipal Corporation, copy of latest paid electricity bill in the name of the applicant;-</LI>
<LI>Proof of place of business (for an owner, in the case of Doing Business): Proof of ownership of premises viz. copy of property card, ownership deed, agreement with the builder or any other relevant documents;-</LI>
<LI>One recent passport-sized photograph of the applicant;-</LI>
<LI>Copy of Income Tax Assessment Order with PAN or copy of PAN card;-</LI>
<LI>Challan on Form No. 210 (original) showing payment of registration fee at INR 5000 (in case of voluntary RC) and INR 500 (in other cases).
</UL>
The whole process will be put online by the spring of 2009. This means that rather than physically having to go to the office, companies will fill in all their details online for Form 101 and then go to the office only so that the Sales Tax Office can verify the above listed-documentation.	
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<STRONG>Step 11:</STRONG> Register for Profession Tax at the Profession Tax Office. Time to complete would be 2 days. It is free of cost. According to section 5 of the Profession Tax Act, every employer (not being an officer of the government) is liable to taxation and shall obtain a certificate of registration from the prescribed authority. The company is required to apply to the registering authority using Form 1.
